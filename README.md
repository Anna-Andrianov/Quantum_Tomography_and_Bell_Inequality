# Quantum_Tomography_and_Bell_Inequality
This project reconstructs entangled quantum states and visualizes them with density matrices, demonstrating photon pulse entanglement in polarization. MATLAB scripts are used to compute the density matrix and verify quantum behavior through Bell's Inequality, with statistical analysis and visualization.
