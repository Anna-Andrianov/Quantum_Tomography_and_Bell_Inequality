# Quantum_Tomography_and_Bell_Inequality
This project reconstructs entangled quantum states and visualizes them with density matrices, demonstrating photon pulse entanglement in polarization. MATLAB scripts are used to compute the density matrix and verify quantum behavior through Bell's Inequality, with statistical analysis and visualization.
## Process Real Data: define_camera_gary.m
Connects to the computer and controls four cameras used in the experiment setup for Alice and Bob, capturing data from each camera to record photon detections and intensities.
## Customize Pixels: Customize_Frames_Pixels.m
Processes each video to identify the specific pixel regions relevant to that video, ensuring the capture of maximal intensity for accurate measurement and analysis. In the tomography process, four distinct pixel regions are selected corresponding to Alice-V, Alice-H, Bob-V, and Bob-H. For Bell's test, the script identifies two sets of pixels, capturing the maximum intensity for Alice and Bob.
## Find Inensities: Find_Max_Intensity_for_AliceBob_V_or_H.m
This script calculates the intensity for each of the four cameras corresponding to Alice-V, Alice-H, Bob-V, and Bob-H for each photon pulse. For every video, pixel regions are customized to capture the maximum intensity. The output generates four graphs showing Intensity [AU] vs Frames for Alice and Bob. The intensities for the selected pixel regions are saved to a CSV file. Ultimately, the data from all videos is combined into a table representing Alice-V, Alice-H, Bob-V, and Bob-H for further analysis.
## Simulate Photon Pulses: gen_random_pulses_to_CVC.m
This script generates random bits representing photon pulses, where |V>=1 and |H>=0. It includes an option to customize the length of the random bit sequence.
### Combining data couloms to excel file :
The data from Find_Max_Intensity_for_AliceBob_V_or_H.m provides intensity measurements for four regions corresponding to Alice-V, Alice-H, Bob-V, and Bob-H. This data is then linked to the random bits generated by gen_random_pulses_to_CVC.m, where vertical polarization |V> is represented by 1 and horizontal polarization |H> by 0. The user can specify the desired number of random bits (10, 25, or 50), which are correlated with the intensity outputs from Alice and Bob. This process allows for the creation of an Excel file containing the necessary information to evaluate entanglement. The resulting data is subsequently used to reconstruct the density matrix, enabling quantum tomography analysis.
## Reconstruct Density Matrix: Quantum_Tomography_Density_Matrix_Complete.m
This script calculates the statistical probabilities of entanglement by reconstructing the density matrix. It visualizes a 4x4 matrix of entanglement probabilities in a 3D plot, representing measurements in both the HH-VV and HV-VH bases.
## Run Simulations: Quantum_Tomography_Density_Matrix_Simulation.m
This script simulates an ideal quantum entangled state of polarization, where the photon states exist in superposition. In the HH-VV basis, if the randomly chosen bit is 0 (H), Bob's state can collapse to either H or V with 50% probability. However, due to the entanglement in this basis, if Bob measures H, Alice must also measure H, and if Bob measures V, Alice must measure V.
A similar simulation exists for the HV-VH basis (though not explicitly used for matrix reconstruction, as the matrix accounts for both bases). In this basis, if the photon state collapses to V, Bob's measurement will result in either V or H with equal probability. If Bob measures H, Alice must measure V, and if Bob measures V, Alice must measure H. This provides a general overview of entanglement behavior across different polarization bases.
## Showw all 16 angles together : Visualize_All_Videos_Together.m
This script processes all 16 pre-defined videos in the order of a set of angles, plotting the frames from each video on the same graph. By combining the data, it allows for easy visualization and comparison of intensity variations across different angles. This visualization is crucial for determining the appropriate threshold required for Bell's Inequality tests.
## Test Bell's Inequality: Bells_Test.m
This script analyzes 16 videos corresponding to a specific set of angles. For each video, it applies a defined threshold and counts the number of detections from Alice and Bob that exceed this threshold. The results are visualized graphically for each video, showing intensity variations. Additionally, the script performs the mathematical calculation of the Bell parameter S and evaluates the uncertainty in S. 
Logic for Calculating the Counts: To calculate $N(\alpha,\beta)$ for Bell’s inequality, the same threshold was applied to the signals detected by Alice and Bob for all angle pairs listed in the article Table.2. For each specific pair of angles, $\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$, we counted the signals exceeding the threshold at each detector, yielding $N_{\alpha,i}$ for Alice and $N_{\beta,i}$ for Bob. The total count for this pair of angles was determined by summing the individual counts: $N_{i}=N_{\alpha,i}+N_{\beta,i}$ . This summation reflects the statistical property of the logical "AND" operation, indicating the simultaneous detection of correlated signals at both detectors, eventually give the joint measurement outcomes for verifying Bell’s inequality.
